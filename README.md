# php-exceptions

This PHP library aims to give you a list of general usage PHP exceptions for your projects. 

Now you don't have to create anymore a `DatabaseException` class for each of your project's components. Just install this package and you will have the globally-available exception `\DatabaseExcepton` - and more others!

## Installation

To install `php-exceptions`, just use the following [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) command:

```
composer require kattsoftware/php-exceptions
```

That's all! The package is compatible with PHP >= 5.3.

## What goodies are included?

You can explore the list of included exceptions by browsing the [`src`](src) directory.

## License

The library is licensed under the MIT License (MIT). See the `LICENSE` file for more information.
